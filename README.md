# droboPhotos
A simple Python script to watch a directory and organises Photos based on EXIF data

### Background

I use DroboPix official app, but I also have an old iPhotos library - I previously used the Hazel App to upload the contents of my iPhotos Library to the drobo to backup my images.

When I got images from friends or family members from their cameras I didn't want to import them to then upload them - so I have a Watch Folder on "Drobo Public" where one can drop JPEG images - these images are then uploaded to the Back Up location in "YEAR/MONTH_NUMBER MONTH" (2019/01 January) format.

If an image exists its removed from "Drobo Public"
